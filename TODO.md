 - do a non-circular special form
 - restore auto app boot  
 - make the babel caching warnings go away
 - land the EAI work properly (with tests, and with all the dynamic imports still working)
 - make ember-resolver work in both modes
   - if we publish as a v2 addon, we can just have two modules and the unused one won't be in the build
   - prune deprecated behaviors and EmberObject out of new resolver
 - currently forcing unstable relase of embroider/macros because it always uses eager importSync
   - can we force this setting from ember-cli, so that all versions in the dep tree do the right thing?
 - had to patch ember-data
